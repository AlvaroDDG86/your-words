      <p class="text-justify bg-white p-2 md:p-8">
        This application was born by the <strong>necessity</strong> of saving
        all the new words you are learning in a unique place. It doesn't matter
        if you are on your way to work, studying at a library, or just listening
        a podcast on spotify, once you want to save a new word, open the app,
        seek the work, type your examples, and if you don't know the meaning,
        just click the button and viola!.

        You can use the application since you signup, this is an alive
        application, I'm always trying to improve its features.

        This is a web application, you only need a browser and Internet, if you
        use the application from a mobile/smartphone, you can install it, and
        the look and feel would be the same as a native app. You can search and
        save your word in your laptop whilst you are studying, and review the
        last word whilst chilling on the sofa.
